# Camera software

Your task is to write a simple photo camera software.
It should support entire process from setting exposure time, aperture size,
focal length, shutter release, and passing raw image to another subsystem
for storing on external memory card. It should support various modes
of operation: fully manual parameter settings, fixed exposure time,
fixed aperture size, fully automatic settings.

In addition, provide model documentation in UML Class Diagram and suite of unit tests
with near full code coverage.

Guidelines:
- follow SOLID principles
- identify and use design patterns where appropriate
- use git to track changes and maintain traceable commit history
- comment relevant pieces of code only
- use doc blocks to document parameters and return types
- use Composer to manage dependencies to third party libraries

Create example file with one use case.
