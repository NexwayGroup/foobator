# Roman numerals

Write a function that takes a number under 4000 as parameter and returns
its representation in Roman numerals.

Bonus points for:
- writing unit tests for testing common cases
- turning the function into a working HTTP API server
- recognizing the big O complexity of a solution for space and computation
- using tail call optimization (even if your language does not support one)

Input used to validate the solution:
- 1024
- 1999
- 2000
- 2001
- 444
- 0
- -9
- 65536
