# Reverse string

Write a function that takes a string as parameter and returns
the same string but in reverse. Do not use built-in/stdandard library functions
for reversing strings or arrays.

Bonus points for:
- writing unit tests for testing common cases
- turning the function into a working HTTP API server
- recognizing the big O complexity of a solution for space and computation

Input used to validate the solution (without quotes):
- "Abcdefghijk"
- "Abcdefghijkl"
- "Abcdefghijkl\n"
- ""
- "Abcd\nefgh\rijkl\tmnop"
- "Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
- "Quick brown fox\0 jumped over the lazy dog"
- "读万卷书不如行万里路"
