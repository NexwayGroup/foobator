# Reverse string

Write a function that takes a string as parameter and returns
the same string but in reverse. Do not use built-in PHP functions
for reversing strings or arrays.

Comment relevant pieces of code only. Use doc blocks to document
parameters and return types.

Writing a unit tests for testing common cases is highly recommended
and will be rewarded with extra points.

Be concious of memory consumption and make sure the function
can process very long strings. Bonus points awarded if you know
the-big-O for space used (leave note in doc block).

Input used to validate the solution (without quotes):
- "Abcdefghijk"
- "Abcdefghijkl"
- "Abcdefghijkl\n"
- ""
- "Abcd\nefgh\rijkl\tmnop"
- "Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
- "Quick brown fox\0 jumped over the lazy dog"
- "读万卷书不如行万里路"
